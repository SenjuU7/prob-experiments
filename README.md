# prob-experiments

Rust-powered experiments on probability, randomness, and data analysis using [Polars](https://pola.rs/).

## Overview
`prob-experiments` is a collection of small projects and simulations exploring concepts in probability and algorithmic randomness.  
The purpose of this repository is to understand how random data behaves under various mathematical and computational conditions.

Focus areas include:
- Random data generation
- Probability distribution simulation
- Hashing and randomness analysis
- Data processing with Polars

## Tech Stack
- Rust
- Polars
- Rand crate (for random number generation)
- Statistical analysis tools

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<SenjuU7>/prob-experiments.git
